      PART I: MURDER IN THE OUTBACKS<br><br>

A scream. A thud. Police sirens going their usual rhythmic tone of 'Wee Woo'- loud enough to wake any sleeping,
 child, and the annoying chatter, not to mention that police sirens were equally annoying too, were the sound of reporters asking the very set of questions they always do. These were the sounds the residents near the house of Mrs. Evelyn Carter- Canning city's mayor, heard, around 6 in the morning on the dreadful date of June 4th. And if it wasn't obvious enough, Mrs. Carter had fallen two stories to her death and, thus, the conundrum.<br><br>

Mr.Garcia, a 30-year-old neighbour, was the one to dial 112 and alert the authorities. Along with him, the concerned neighbours were Mr. and Mrs. Evans, the Winchester family, the Rory's and the elderly couples Mr and Mrs. Sinclair.<br> <br>

The case file dropped on the table of the, rather inexperienced, detective Arthur Leghorne. Arthur had no prior experience in any murder let alone the case of the city’s Mayor herself. Luck would have him board the train from Aigburth to Canning and set up his own agency. All these events leading to him getting this case.<br><br>

Arthur was an interesting character on the surface level. If you wanted to know about his past, there would be no records of him. Even friends who knew him closely didn't know who his family were, or even he had any.<br><br>

<hr>
PART II: THE SLAVE OF HONOR<br><br>

It had been almost two weeks after Arthur was handed the case. With a lack of evidence, he concluded the case and it had come on to an anticlimactic end, which was probably for the better. The case was recorded as an "accidental death".<br><br>

The case was now done and dusted, and the next step was to report the conclusions to the city sheriff, Joseph Wilkins.<br><br>

Upon reaching sheriff office at half-past-ten, Arthur found the visitor's seat taken, and the office already occupied. <br>
<br>
'Arthur', Joseph called out in quite an unreadable tone, just as Arthur was about to exit the room and wait in the lobby. ‘We were just discussing your case'<br>
<br>
This line peaked Arthur's curiosity. It was random as who else would this case be discussed between except Arthur and the sheriff themselves.<br><br>

The guest opposite Joseph, who Arthur had initially noticed, peeked behind him and took notice of Arthur and now had left his chair to approach the detective. The man was of a very squarish build, and had the strength of, Arthur guessed, at least ten elephants. Dressed in a black suit, the man was the most intimidating person Arthur had ever come across in his time in the city.<br><br>

'Good to meet you, Arthur', the man spoke.
'Let me introduce you', the sheriff then spoke, 'this is the newly elected mayor, Mr.Vincent.'<br>
After shaking away his initial fright on seeing the mayor, Arthur began his synopsis on the case.<br>
'I've solved the case', he began with.<br>
'Quite astonishing, isn't it, Arthur?’a glint of awe was visible in the sheriff's eyes.<br>
'Go ahead, I’m interested to hear', the mayor implored in a firm voice.<br>
'The death was accidental, of course, because of a lack of proper evidence, and no suspects, seem to be out of place'<br><br>

The sheriff seemed dissatisfied with this report, which Arthur picked on how his tone of voice changed from an excited child, to a depressing murmur, within moments after Arthur's dialogue.
<br><br>
The mayor too didn't look pleased. Well, it was obvious from the drastic change in atmosphere
.<br><br>

'Arthur, are you su-', the sheriff was cut off from finishing his sentence by the mayor.<br>
'Now that’s a problem, detective', Vincent began, 'You see mate, this “accidental death” and suchlike nonsense, which we both know is your cover for protecting the people, is complete crap. It won't please the press. See, Arthur, politics isn't what you think it is. The people play no role in this, but, the media, the press, they're the deciding factor.<br><br>

By framing this as a murder, I could say that the culprit was found by someone from my department. The press won't dig up this "accidental death"-crap, but instead, if you give them a case like murder, that'll double almost everything,…..even your fame as a detective' <br><br> 

The mayor had now began to return to his seat opposite the sheriff.

'I'm not doing it.'<br>
The mayor now quit his action of sitting, and stood up again. He took a look at the confident Arthur. <br>
'Sorry?', the mayor said, clearly taken aback with this sudden statement, for no one had even dared to talk to him with the sheer confidence and boldness that Arthur had presented him with. <br>
'I'm not doing this for the press or for the fame'<br><br>

The instant he said this, Arthur turned and maintained his grip on the doorknob to leave, when the mayor called out to him,<br>
'Alphonse d'Cruz, loan shark, who you own £3,750,<br>
William Smiths, moneylender, who you own almost £10,000 to, 
Sam Paul, loan shark, who you own £5,500 to.
All that, with interest, is about £45,000. You came to Canning, not because of luck, did ya? Instead, you "escaped" Aigburth to leave behind your previous life and get settled here, am not missing anything, am I?'<br>

The answer to the last question was an obvious no, and everyone in the room had figured it out. Arthur's hands, trembling, his heart, pounding so loud he’d rather have thought it was placed right close to his ears. There was now no possible escape from this situation. If Arthur was to still deny the order in the false accusations, his details would be made public, and the creditors would have almost no trouble tracking him down.<br><br>

'So', the mayor continued in an intimidating tone, 'do we a deal?'

The only answer here was, yes.
<hr>
PART III: TO KILL THE WOUNDED MOUSE<br><br>

Mr.Garcia was the perfect scapegoat to be blamed on for the murder, and was turned over the following week. His son, daughter and wife cried, fell to the feet of the policemen to have sympathy over them and pleaded with them with all their might, with no avail. Garcia had no power now. Although it was widely said he would do no such thing, there was no one who could save him. <br><br>

Without the financial support from the only working man in the family, the three slowly crumbled and drowned in poverty. The only escape from out of this situation seemed to be from death itself. A single, irreversible departure for good. <br><br>

The gun, stored for emergencies in the safe of the house seemed the only way to achieve this. There was no hesitation loading it, and ultimately, pulling the trigger. The three, had chosen to end their own lives. <br><br>

The news reached the man in prison half-hour later.<br> <br>

Garcia cried, his legs shook uncontrollably, his hands trembled in fear, the soles of his feet sweat, his heart thumped like a rock, blood gushed through his veins faster than ever. He was as helpless as a lamb surrounded by hungry tigers, and the tiger in this case was the very politics that had trapped him  here in the first place. <br><br>

The mayor's government put out a statement saying that the mayor's case was solved by someone sent from their government, which made him a clear favourite to win the elections, ultimately leading to this fate.<br><br>

The desparity took over Arthur who, similar to the man he put in jail, felt utterly helpless. He was neither unable to lay in bed and get a good six-hour-sleep, nor was he able to sit on his couch without having a restless feeling come over him.<br><br>

Things became bad when he refused to even step onto his apartment simply because every object there shone his reflection and he was unable to stand it. They seemed to shout at him like he was the reason for the helpless immigrant stuck in jail, for everything he had done in his past, and for why he's even living.<br><br>

This was it. He just couldn't take it anymore. He ran around his apartment in desperation, looking for something and nothing at the same time. <br><br>

He opened his drawers, cabinets and what not, ultimately to having a rope on his hands. His mind picked on the ceiling fan, the only thing making noise other than Arthur's thumping heart, and stitched the idea to hang himself by tying the rope on the fan and strangle himself.<br> <br>

He took a stool, stood on it, and counted.
3..2..1..<br><br>

and thud.<br><br>

He jumped off the stool, but the fan couldn't handle the force and collapsed- a good thing for any sane person, except Arthur, bringing both the fan and Arthur down on the floor.<br><br>

"This Lawyer Can Take It All. Call 'Gibbs Law Firm<sup>TM</sup> Today!", the AD read on the cover-page of the morning page which Arthur read with his tear-filled eyes. This felt like a sign for him. "When in Need, Call Gibbs"  he then read.This felt like a sign for him, and it was. He knew this was his only real chance.
<br><br>

PART IV: THE GUY IN THE LAW FIRM<br><br>

On the walk to his office room, Gibbs received his usual set of greetings, consisting of a ‘good day’, and the rest being the usual ‘good morning’. <br><br>

'Good Morning, Rose', Gibbs greeted his secretary opposite to his desk. <br>
Rose didn't reply, and tried her best to ignore the cheerful man opposite her.<br>
'Rosey's a bit moody now, huh', Gibbs tried again.<br>
'There's an Arthur sitting outside for the past hour. He’s  been coming and going and coming and going for the past week.
Do you have any comprehension of your clients, Gibbs?', an angry uproar from the usually angry Rose was the best possible start to Gibbs' day. The second best, being getting shouted at by angry couples on why their divorce papers weren't ready.
'Listen', Gibbs defended himself, 'you know how busy I'm with the kids and all and now Chris is suspended, so please, understand'<br>
'Deal with the guy first, I'll send the guy in?'<br>
'Go ahead', the senetence said in an exhausted voice but there wasn't another choice for Gibbs.<br><br>

The man entered the room. Pale skin with heavy bags under his eyes indicating he hadn't slept for days if not weeks. He sat on the prompt of being asked to sit. <br><br>

Gibbs took a look at his complaint after it was handed it to him. The complaint on the paper was hand-written with scribbly and delicate handwriting. <br><br>

"Dear sir,
with no where else to go I come to you. If you want to, you can kick me out and not let me near the office again. But try your best to understand me.<br><br>

I am Arthur Leghorne, detective of the recent case of murder of the mayor. The culprit was wrongly accused and was done so for the sake of fame for the government. The case itself was an accidental death.<br><br>

It would be my absolute pleasure if you would look into my case."<br><br>

Gibbs took two reads of the note and kept it aside after which he promptly asked Rose to give them some privacy. 
<br><br>
'Mr.Arthur, I don't know whether you have any problem with the mayor or anything else, but, don't get me wrong, why would I even believe you?'<br><br>

Arthur's soulless eyes pierced into Gibbs’. It was obvious that this man had no life left and was treating him as a last resort. On realizing that Gibbs had no intent in helping him, Arthur sat up and turned to leave the room.<br><br>

'Mr.Arthur', Gibbs called out, 'I can help you, but, a case against the mayor, and to win the case is, well, utterly impossible to say the least'<br><br>

Arthur said nothing, and he had nothing to say. He left the room and the five minutes he was there, hadn't uttered a single word.
<br><br>
For Gibbs, he knew that to take up case like this was throwing himself into the dragon’s cave, and risking everything. Also, taking up case against a person in control of him was the equivalent to walking into a minefield.<br><br>

The afternoon, Gibbs went to the mayor’s office. Upon reaching the mayor's office, he seemed preoccupied with his mates who he was enjoying a few laughs and drinks with. Gibbs after a run through of their faces, identified one of them to be the town Sheriff. 
<br><br>
'Gibbs! Come in, come in', the mayor ordered him, still laughing. Gibbs stepped closer in the room.<br><br>

'What brings you here?', the mayor asked.<br>
'Someone brought up a case against you this morning', Gibbs answered.<br>
On hearing this, the party went silent. Sheriff Wilkins and Vincent shared glances with dread in their eyes. <br><br>

Within the next minute, the room was empty except for the mayor, sheriff and Gibbs, who then explained all what was shared in his office. <br><br>

'Who was it?', was the first question asked by the sheriff.<br>
The answer 'A mister Arthur' from Gibbs' mouth moved something in the other two. The mayor had been successful in maintaining a façade of toughness but inside, he had been shook to the core. The both knew that if this became public, the press would eat them alive. <br><br>

Vincent stoop up. 'Your son's at home right?', he asked in the same tone which he asked Arthur a week before in their encounter at their office. <br>
Gibbs could do nothing but nod.<br>
'Listen here Gibbs. If anyone other than the three of us knows about this, I'll make sure that this morning will be the last time you see your son. Got it?’ <br><br>

Gibbs' face had a visible splash of fear, which on seeing, made the other two in the room relieved. Not only was he now sure that a person trusted by the people so much would turn out to be like this, but it also confirmed the risks that would come from this. He had now put his son's and his life in danger. The lawyer stepped out of he room visibly deeply rattled indeed.<br><br>

He returned to his office. Normally he would have had a few laughs with his secretary, but today, he just sat on his chair, silently, staring at the note that was written to him by the visitor earlier that morning.
<br><br>

He returned home late with visible dread on his face. He took his place in his study after checking on his son. He then put up the note on his table. <br><br>

'Do I take the risk, or not?' was the thought running in his mind. Not taking it meant no risks, but it also meant in siding with the wrong. <br>

Taking it meant meant an obvious risk, but also siding with the good.<br><br>

'Dad?', a voice in the hallway opposite to him jumped him. It was his nine-year-old son, Jolly.<br>

Gibbs answered him, and told him to take a seat on the chair next to him. <br>

In a stern voice Gibbs asked the half-awake toddler, 'Why did you get the suspension?'<br>

Fear took control over the poor boy's face, and he gripped his teddy, which he slept with, very tightly, which his father took notice and took it as a sign for guilt.<br>

'It's okay, I won't shout', Gibbs assured him.<br>

'A pun-punched a b-boy, in the f-face, for hitting a girl in m c-c-class', the boy told him while stuttering.<br>

A moment of realization took over Gibbs. As he stared into his son's guilty face, he realized who even his son sided with right, knowing the risks.<br>

'Good Morning, Rose', Gibbs greeted his secretary opposite to his desk. <br>
Rose didn't reply, and tried her best to ignore the cheerful man opposite her.<br>
'Rosey's a bit moody now, huh', Gibbs tried again.<br>
'There's an Arthur sitting outside for the past hour. He’s been coming and going and coming and going for the past week. Do you have any comprehension of your clients, Gibbs?', an angry uproar from the usually angry Rose was the best possible start to Gibbs' day. The second best, being getting shouted at by angry couples on why their divorce papers weren't ready.<br>
'Listen', Gibbs defended himself, 'you know how busy I'm with the kids and all and now Chris is suspended, so please, understand'<br>
'Deal with the guy first, I'll send him in now'<br>
'Go ahead', the senetence said in an exhausted voice but there wasn't another choice for Gibbs.<br><br>


The man entered the room. Pale skin with heavy bags under his eyes indicating he hadn't slept for days if not weeks. He sat on the prompt of being asked to sit. <br><br>


Gibbs took a look at his complaint after it was handed it to him. The complaint on the paper was hand-written with scribbly and delicate handwriting. <br><br>


"Dear sir,
with no where else to go I come to you. If you want to, you can kick me out and not let me near the office again. But try your best to understand me.<br><br>


I am Arthur Leghorne, detective of the recent case of murder of the mayor. The culprit was wrongly accused and was done so for the sake of fame for the government. The case itself was an accidental death.<br><br>


It would be my absolute pleasure if you would look into my case."<br><br>


Gibbs took two reads of the note and kept it aside after which he promptly asked Rose to give them some privacy. 
<br><br>
'Mr.Arthur, I don't know whether you have any problem with the mayor or anything else, but, don't get me wrong, why would I even believe you?'<br><br>


Arthur's soulless eyes pierced into Gibbs’. It was obvious that this man had no life left and was treating him as a last resort. On realizing that Gibbs had no intent in helping him, Arthur sat up and turned to leave the room.<br><br>


'Mr.Arthur', Gibbs called out, 'I can help you, but, a case against the mayor, and to win the case is, well, utterly impossible to say the least'<br><br>


Arthur said nothing, and he had nothing to say. He left the room and for the five minutes he was there, he hadn't uttered a single word.
<br><br>
For Gibbs, he knew that to take up case like this was throwing himself into the dragon’s cave, with nothing but his pride, and risking everything. Also, taking up case against a person in control of him was the equivalent to walking into a minefield.<br><br>


The afternoon, Gibbs went to the mayor’s office. Upon reaching the mayor's office, he seemed preoccupied with his mates who he was enjoying a few laughs and drinks with. Gibbs after a run through of their faces, identified one of them to be the town Sheriff. 
<br><br>
'Gibbs! Come in, come in', the mayor ordered him, still laughing. Gibbs stepped closer in the room.<br><br>


'What brings you here?', the mayor asked.<br>
'Someone brought up a case against you this morning', Gibbs answered.<br>
On hearing this, the party went silent. Sheriff Wilkins and Vincent shared glances with dread in their eyes. <br><br>


Within the next minute, the room was empty except for the mayor, sheriff and Gibbs, who then explained all what was shared in his office. <br><br>


'Who was it?', was the first question asked by the sheriff.<br>
The answer 'A mister Arthur' from Gibbs' mouth moved something in the other two. The mayor had been successful in maintaining a façade of toughness but inside, he had been shook to the core. The both knew that if this became public, the press would eat them alive. <br><br>


Vincent stoop up. 'Your son's at home right?', he asked in the same tone which he asked Arthur a week before in their encounter at their office. <br>
Gibbs could do nothing but nod.<br>
'Listen here Gibbs. If anyone other than the three of us knows about this, I'll make sure that this morning will be the last time you see your son. Got it?’ <br><br>


Gibbs' face had a visible splash of fear, which on seeing, made the other two in the room relieved. Not only was he now sure that a person trusted by the people so much would turn out to be like this, but it also confirmed the risks that would come from this. He had now put his son's and his life in danger. The lawyer stepped out of he room visibly deeply rattled indeed.<br><br>


He returned to his office. Normally he would have had a few laughs with his secretary, but today, he just sat on his chair, silently, staring at the note that was written to him by the visitor earlier that morning.
<br><br>


He returned home late with visible dread on his face. He took his place in his study after checking on his son. He then put up the note on his table. <br><br>


"Do I take the risk, or not?" was the thought running in his mind. Not taking it meant no risks, but it also meant in siding with the wrong. <br>


Taking it meant meant an obvious risk, but also siding with the good.<br><br>


'Dad?', a voice in the hallway opposite to him jumped him. It was his nine-year-old son, Jolly.<br>


Gibbs answered him, and told him to take a seat on the chair next to him. <br>


In a stern voice Gibbs asked the half-awake toddler, 'Why did you get the suspension?'<br>


Fear took control over the poor boy's face, and he gripped his teddy, which he slept with, very tightly, which his father took notice and took it as a sign for guilt.<br>


'It's okay, I won't shout', Gibbs assured him.<br>


'I pun-punched a b-boy, in the f-face, for hitting a girl in my c-c-class', the boy told him while stuttering.<br>


A moment of realization took over Gibbs. As he stared into his son's guilty face, he realized that even his son sided with right, knowing the risks.<br>


Gibbs gave the boy a tight hug, and he hugged him to sleep. He was now sure what he will do. He had to take the choose the good side, and he had to take the risks. <br><br>


The top priority moving on from now was to win the case that had been presented to him and take Vincent out of control for the safety of his own, and the safety of his son. Everything was in stake now.<br><br>

PART V: WAR<br><br>


The next morning, Gibbs walked in desparity to his office, ignoring all the greetings thrown at him as well as ignoring his secretary. He seemed lost in a maze with no escape out. <br><br>


Gibbs didn't waste more than an hour in his office, and rode down to meet judge Davis Thompson and filed the case then and there. As he exited the judge's office, he felt a weight off of his shoulders, but, the case wasn't over yet. There was also the court proceedings too.<br>


After a few days the case reached the court. Gibbs representing the culprit Mr.Garcia, and the mayor represented by his employee. Arthur was present in the courthouse for the case, feeling an immeasurable guilt on seeing the convict in handcuffs.<br><br>


On the side of the defendants, there was a chance for redemption. For the side of the accused, there was nothing to worry about for, in Vincent's words, no such simple case could topple his reputation as the mayor.
<br><br>
Judge Davies entered the room. After a moment of respect, the hammer hit, and court was in session.
<br><br>
'I hereby proclaim the court is now in session', the judge began, 'May the defendant, convict Ryan Garcia, and his representatives rise and begin the prosecution'<br>
A heavy breath and glimpse of the room behind him later, Gibbs began, 'Your Honour, I would like to call a witness on to the stands'<br>
After his wishes were granted, Gibbs called the sheriff on.<br>


'Mr.Wilkins, you were the case directive for the case of the mayor. May I see the documents of the case?'<br>
The question asked stumped the witness for the case was decided on anonymously and no documents were prepared to say that Garcia had done the case.<br>
'I object Your Honour', the law representative of the mayor stood up, 'Why would the case document prove helpful for the case?'<br>
'My Honour', Gibbs intercepted, 'No documents were prepared for the case, pointing simply to the fact that the detective in charge of this case was influenced by the sheriff and the mayor in accusing my client of murdering Mrs. Evelyn'<br><br>


The faces of the mayor and the sheriff turned pale.<br><br>


'My Honour', Gibbs continued, 'I'd also like to call the detective that worked on the case.' After getting the permission, Gibbs called on Arthur on to the stage.<br><br>


'Mr. Arthur', Gibbs started, 'I need a truthful answer from you, were you or were you not influenced by the mayor and his allies into making the case as a murder?'<br><br>


Arthur, even though completely lifeless on the outside, was smiling in the inside, and after taking a look at the now helpless mayor, he answered,'Yes. Yes I was'<br><br>


The court room erupted. The audience gasping, turning their eyes to the somewhat soulless mayor, who has now been exposed for his dirty business.<br><br>


'That's all, Your Honour', Gibbs concluded.<br><br>


The judge now had enough evidence to ask the jury for their verdict. He asked, 'Has the jury reached a verdict.'


'For the case of unfair influence and defamation' the jury began, 'the court finds the defendant guilty and forces that both the mayor and the sheriff be stripped of any political powers and be given a life-sentence, while also stripping any charge off of culprit Ryan Garcia'<br><br>


After the final hit of the hammer by the judge, a visible smile was visible on both Gibbs’ and Arthur's faces. For the mayor, the case bit him sourly. His eyes frantically ran across the room.<br> <br>


When he stood up, he felt all the eyes in the room was directed right at him. He stumbled
 a little while walking, his heart was the one beating instead of the detective or the former culprit. He hid his face from the press while exiting the court. The press was the only thing he was doing all this for. <br><br>


That night marked the last night in power for both the sheriff and the mayor. On an unexpected cold rainy night, Mr.Garcia entered the empty station, consisting of only the former sheriff packing his stuff for his resignation.<br><br>


Garcia entered the office, stood opposite the desk, behind of which was Joseph, who lifted his head to see his visitor and was almost taken aback when he realized that it was the man who lost his family because of him. <br><br>


Joseph thought that Garcia wanted an apology, but the sheriff couldn't be more wrong. The man standing near the door was in this instance, armed. Garcia lifted the pistol, directed at the sheriff's head. <br><br>


The sheriff could have pleaded, but he didn't, knowing it was useless. In the blink of an eye, the trigger went off. Revenge was complete.<br><br>


On the mayor's residence, there was nothing jolly. The mayor walked around his room, knowing that his image was crushed and there wasn't a way he would spend his life in a prison.<br><br>


The thought run around his brain, but he knew there wasn't an escape, unless...<br><br>


He took notice of the gun on the desk. There wasn't anything he could do now to make better what he had done. The trigger went off. Again. Loudly. Painfully. <br><br>


'Breaking News as the both the mayor and the sheriff which were to begin their life sentences has committed suicide', was all that was on the news that next day.<br><br>


If the mayor had any connection with any mobs, they would target Gibbs, and he knew this, prompting Gibbs flee town with his son. <br><br>


Arthur too fled city, catching the next train to an unknown destination. It was an oppurtunity for Arthur to begin things again.<br><br>


An happy ending came over the city of Canning. The new mayor, was a better one compared to Vincent-a relief for the people.<br><br>


A few months passed by. The city had been slowly healing and had moved on from the tragedy, seen from the plaque for both the Garcia's and Mrs. Evelyn placd on the city hall, the mayor, playing her part in all of this.<br><br> 


Garcia found peace again, but also felt a part of him missing too. He got his job back. The people of the town regrew their trust in him. Garcia's icing on the cake being that he got his job back, the one he maintained before the scandal. Life had forgiven the man and he in turn thanked it for this. <br><br>


Gibbs became a great lawyer a few cities across, and an even better dad, being there for Jolly when it mattered-bringing him closer than ever before. Gibbs knew his life wasn't perfect, but it had become better now. <br><br>


Arthur stayed low for a few months before becoming a detective at a trusted agency and finding his foothold back in life.<br><br>


It was a fairy tale ending for both the city of Canning, and the the two that fled the city. <br><br>
