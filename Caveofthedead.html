PART I: The Little Quokka <br><br>

<i>MASSACHUSETTS, U.S.A</i><br><br>

The chatter seemed to grow in the hallway louder by the second. Razi climbed along the stairs, sticking right, the side where it was less probable to bump into someone, but with her luck, she did anyways. After a moment of mindless walking, she reached her destination, ‘HISTORY CLASS- MR DAVIS’, as it was displayed on the board outside. Even though the class was boring for any 6th grader, Mr.Davis still found a way to hook everyone in.<br><br>

“‘Mornin’, class”, Mr.Davis said after the loudness of the class had finally died down. “Today, each of you will be assigned a group assignment."<br><br>

“Probably some lame assignment about the U.S presidents”, the boy turned and said to her. Ben,his name was, one of the only friends she had in the entire class. Sure, some say he was sort of a prick, but she knows deep down that he has a caring nature, especially towards his classmates. <br><br>

Razi nodded.<br><br>

 “And no, it isn’t about any of the former presidents.” Mr.Davis added, sparing a glance at them, “But, rather, about the mysteries happening around us.”
<br><br>
That made Razi’s senses perk up. Excitedly, she asked “What mysteries, sir?”<br><br>

“Well, Razi, you have been put with Ben,  Sam and Kate”, the response followed by unspoken cheer in the room.<br><br>

“And your project is to write about the R.M Cave, and its mystery.”<br><br>

The R.M Cave? The name sounded familiar. Very familiar. Razi thought about it, and finally got it. That cave was the ‘Cave Of The Dead’. This did nothing but elevate her excitement for the project a little further.<br><br>

During lunch, two hours later, the group sat together.<br><br>

“The cave seems… well, creepy”, Sam commented after Razi had explained the deal with the cave.<br>
“Sure does”, Razi replied.<br>
“Guys! Wouldn’t be cool to like, actually go investigate it”, Kate commented<br>
The table looked at each other in wonder, except for Razi.<br>
“Did you not hear me? This cave is called ‘The Cave Of The Dead’”<br>
“Gosh! You are such a party pooper”, Sam sharply replied. The sentence seemed to match the loudness of the room. “What about you Ben?”<br>
Ben stayed quiet. He did not reply.<br>
“Ok then”, Kate declared, “We visit the cave this Friday.”<br><br>
<hr>

PART II: FRIDAY THE 13<sup>th</sup><br><br>

The weekend rolled in, and a terrified group of kids boarded the bus, straight to their research haven. Upon reaching, half-hour after midnight, they saw themselves staring into what seemed like…a dragon’s mouth.<br><br>

“I don’t feel good about this”, Razi declared, trying to persuade her friends to not go into the cave, which was an obvious invite for danger. But, after hearing what they had to say, she knew her efforts were in vain.<br><br>

At midnight, they boarded the bus straight to the cave, and in an hour they arrived. They entered the cave, and after half a mile, the first question was asked by Kate.<br>
“What are we even looking for in here?”<br>
“There are ominous cave marks here, and even a description of a…red orb deep in”, Sam quickly answered.<br><br>

The rest of the expedition was silent, creepily silent. All four had wristwatches on them to take note of  the time, and when the decided upon limit of two hours rolled in, they turned to leave, bringing about relief on Razi’s face.<br><br>

After some time for what seemed like ages, they came to a twisted path that they hadn’t encountered on their way here. The path, just seemingly appearing before them.<br><br>

The group decided on sticking to the right path, and walked along, with Ben and Razi leading before them. The group had come to a dead end, and when turning to leave, fell upon the realisation that there were only 2 people there.<br><br>

“Sam! Kate! This isn't a joke”, screamed the two. The two were pranksters, but of this degree was unheard of.<br><br>

Maybe they had run out, following this idea they were concerned, they ran too. Upon reaching the mouth of the cave, they looked around, frantically. But, nothing.<br><br>

“Razi, it’s dangerous here” Ben said with a shaky voice, “we need to go!”
“And leave our friends behind, Ben? We need to find them!<br>
“What if they… boarded another bus, or… ran away. What then Razi? We’re putting ourselves in danger too.” <br><br>

Razi still tried, and tried, but it was to no avail. The two found themselves at their homes, and after an hour of sleep, they tried contacting the missing, but still,  nothing. <br><br>

<hr>
PART III: Mel Fisher And His Adventures <br><br>
The night rolled in, and the duo had no regard for safety in mind. In fact, they had nothing in mind, other than the mission to find their friends. <br><br>

They stood in front of the cave, entirely shaking inside. They reached the point they had reached before when they had heard the sounds of their friends, calling out. They ran, and ran and-<br>

Before them WAS Kate, only difference being that it was her lifeless body. She was dead. She was… killed.<br><br>

Razi, on an empty stomach, threw up the remaining bits of strawberry granola bar. After getting back on her feet, she broke down to tears, with only Ben to comfort her.<br><br>

“HELLO!”, someone called out. He sounded almost like- no, EXACTLY like Sam. The kids now ran once again, but found nothing, except for the ruins of an underground civilisation….and something illuminating within.<br><br>

“Sam might be there”, Ben said, “I’ll go have a look”<br><br>

Between the ruins and them, was a valley, with a river flowing through. Ben’s only challenge to reach the light was the river. He slid down, and kept sliding, without a stop.<br><br>

He screamed in terror, for the river, instead of a cool sensation, was burning him alive, devouring his legs.<br><br>

Razi too tried to crept down to  save him, but as luck would have it, she was a bit too far. She saw her friend get devoured by the river….and ran back to the opening, still in tears. <br><br>

She reached home, more drenched in guilt than yesterday. She neither slept, nor ate; she neither talked, nor listened.<br><br>

Missing posters were set up every corner. Alll three had one, and she hoped that she could find at least one of them.<br><br>
<hr>
PART IV: A CENTURION CURSE<br><br>

She found herself, once again, face-to-face with the cave, which seemed to produce the sounds of a thousand people at once, echoing inside Razi’s ears. She went in, and reached Ben’s grave’s spot, and got ready to accomplish what Ben wanted to.<br><br>
Her first leg on stone suspended in the river, the other raised high and hanging about, and resting on the next block. Sometimes, the river seemed to form waves, and burning her skin off, but she had to carry on.<br><br>

At last, the valley was crossed. And she lay her eyes on the path in front. The illumination seemed both far and close at the same time.<br><br>

She walked along the path, covered in fossil-rocks, and symbols on the walls, seeming to make their escape from the wall.<br><br>

 Has anyone reached this far?,  she wondered and stayed true to her target. Weirdly enough, Sam’s voice had echoed no more. Was he too gone? No! Don’t  think that! She moved forward.<br><br>

At the end of the hall showed a magnificent red orb with an eerie crimson glow. A weird sight for sure. <br>
Wait! Why was she here? What was she thinking of when she entered the cave? And….who even is she?<br><br>

Her arm spasmed, and to any passerby it would seem like she was… attracted to the orb. It rose without her consent, and though she tried to fight it, it touched the orb.<br><br>

“Razi?”Ben called out. She opened her eyes and in front of her, were the three friends, in what seemed like their school cafeteria but it was…empty. She felt empty within.<br><br>

“What happened?”, Kate asked, with concern on her face.<br>
“Nothing”<br>
“Are you sure?”<br>
“Yeah, totally”<br><br>

It was with the awe she saw the shift in Kate, for she had never seen that side of her. She took a bite of her sandwich-which was without a doubt, the best one she’d ever had.
